# FRACTALSIM
FRACTALSIM is a multi-scenario genome-wide medical population genetics simulation framework. FractalSIM has the capability to accurately mimic and generate genome-wide data under various genetic models on genetic diversity, genomic variation affecting diseases and DNA sequence patterns of admixed and/or homogeneous populations.
